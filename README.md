# Latex-Code
This is my random undergrad Electrical lab assignments done in latex...using the software for first time

The mains codes here..make necessary changes!

    \section*{Discussion:} 
	We tried our best to minimize all possible physical and experimental errors while conducting the experiment. We proceeded by connecting all wires properly according to the circuit diagram. But still due to some unfortunate events slight errors took place. The reasons behind this incident are- \\   
	Internal voltage drop in the devices used in this experiment.Moreover,
	the wires were rusty and some were previously damaged.As we used analog ammeter in this experiment,there were possibilities of some improper readings taken by the observer.We observed that,there were difference in the original reading and reading we took due to  internal resistance of the electrical devices. Overall the experiment went flawlessly as we expected with some minimal errors.
